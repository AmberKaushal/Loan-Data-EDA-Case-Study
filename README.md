# Loan-Data-EDA-Case-Study
To understand risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
# Problem Statement
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. 
The company wants to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
## The orgnization wants you to ananlyze the data and suggest:-

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
## Solution
We have performed EDA and identified the pattern present in the data and provide recommendations to the Organisation. We have used Jupyter Notebook.
